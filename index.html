					<h3>Web Development</h3>
					<p>I have built several websites for World Of Warcraft private Sevrers and have host a few for guild
						recruitment. It what its what got me started in websites
						development. I enjoy trouble shooting and design website. However this is not a main passion of
						mine. I can provide the knowledge but long term not a pathway forward.
						I built this website with html code and css. Hosted via github.

					<h3>Cyber Security</h3>
					<p>I am pursing a career in cyber security. Its my passion to secure and maintain privacy to all
						whom want to seek it. I think its important to maintain a certain level
						of having thing secure while also being practical in your approach to base issues that are
						present in the cyber field. Cyber world has many hurtles one of those being
						constantly evolving. There are tons of way to appraoch one issue. Sometime you think you might
						have the right approach but it turns out there is a better way of going
						about the same solution. I am proud to be moving to a field I think will continue to grow with
						us. Its the future of how we look at life. We have more technoloy
						beside us more then ever before. You never find youself without.

					<h3>Cyber World</h3>
					<p>The cyber world is only going to continue to grow and evolve as time goes forward. Problems we
						used to face like someone cracking our wifi now has great consequences
						then ever. Allowing someone onto your network now poses so many risk that you could potentially
						have all your information stolen. The best way to prevent yourself from
						these risk is to limit exposure. Limit whom you allow to share stuff on your network, limit whom
						you allow to do things to your phone,ipads computers. Everything is subject
						to having information stolen. People that say well my information is out there I don't care.
						Well I say this your PII(Personal Idenifical Information) out in the world.
						That's something that should bother you . It's like having someone hanging out in your life full
						time taking whats your and claiming its theirs. Thats just one way cyber criminals
						take advatage of people..</p>
