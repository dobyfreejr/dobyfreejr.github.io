						<h3>Cyber Security</h3>
						<p>I am pursing a career in cyber security. Its my passion to secure and maintain privacy to all whom want to seek it. I think its important to maintain a certain level
							of having thing secure while also being practical in your approach to base issues that are present in the cyber field. Cyber world has many hurtles one of those being
							constantly evolving. There are tons of way to appraoch one issue. Sometime you think you might have the right approach but it turns out there is a better way of going
							about the same solution. I am proud to be moving to a field I think will continue to grow with us. Its the future of how we look at life. We have more technoloy
							beside us more then ever before. You never find youself without.
